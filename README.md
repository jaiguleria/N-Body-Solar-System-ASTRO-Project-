# N-Body Python Simulation of the Solar System

## Introduction

This repository contains my third-year Astronomy project, which focuses on creating an N-Body Python simulation of the Solar System. The simulation models bodies as point masses and utilizes Runge-Kutta (RK45) differential equations to track their orbits. Additionally, Voyager 2's trajectory is mapped out with the use of JPL Horizons Ephemerides. 

## Features

- Models bodies as point masses
- Utilizes Runge-Kutta (RK45) differential equations
- Tracks orbits of bodies in the Solar System
- Maps Voyager 2's trajectory using JPL Horizons Ephemerides
- Evolves the system from 2D, 1-body to 3D, 2-body, and finally an N-body system
- Compares simulation data against JPL's data
- Applies corrections where necessary
- Explores the N-body problem and basics of Chaos Theory

## Usage

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/n-body-simulation.git
