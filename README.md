My third‑year Astronomy project - creating an N‑Body Python simulation of the Solar System, modelling bodies as point masses
with the use of Runge‑Kutta (RK45) differential equations to track their orbits, with Voyager 2’s trajectory mapped out with the use of JPL Horizons
Ephemerides. Evolved the system from a 2D, 1‑body to a 3D, 2‑body system followed by an N‑body system, comparing my data against JPL’s and applying
corrections where necessary. The project delves into the N‑body problem and the basics of Chaos Theory.
